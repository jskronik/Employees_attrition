# employee_attrition

In this project I am uncovering the factors that lead to employee attrition.
After examining selected business problems, I proceed to build different machine learning models,
test their performence with the use of different metrics, and in the final phase of the project
make prediction using the model with the best performence.

This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.
